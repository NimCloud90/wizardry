<h2 style="text-align: center;">Friendship wins.</h2>
<p>The creatures you have met on this journey have shown you that they aren't inherently harmful, so you figured neither would the Evil Dungeon Master. You walk through the doorway of the Throne Room.</p>
<p>You feel something carress your arm, and although spooked, you held yourself firm and opened up a conversation without turning around.</p>
<p>Surprisingly you hear plain English spoken back right at you, which you have not heard ever since you left the Knight in the forest, "My, my, what a kind and ambitious soul you are."</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The voice echoes through the walls of your mind nonstop, but you try to power through and give them an answer back.</p>
