<h2>You try to fight the snail.</h2>
<p>But as soon as your hand glazes the snail's skin, you become disgusted rather quickly and stop immediately.</p>
<p>It doesn't seem to notice you hit it at all, eyestalks giving a small bob of acknowledgement and the snail carries on it's merry way.</p>
<p>With you path now unblocked, you can head to the Throne Room now.</p>
