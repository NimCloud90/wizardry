<h2 style="text-align: center;">You surrendered to the snail.</h2>

<p>Your bodies collide. No one is happy with that outcome.</p>

<p>The snail glides away from you as quickly as possible, not wanting to spend another moment in that awkward situation.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">With nothing left here for you to do you can now start kindly making your way to the Throne Room.</p>

<button (click)="gotoThroneRoom()" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;">Go to the Throne Room</button>
