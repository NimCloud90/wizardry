<h2 style="text-align: center;">You took the left.</h2>
<p>As you start to make the turn you notice a towering shadow to your side, but you don't hear a singlular sound of feet gliding against the ground.</p>
<p>As you figure out what to do about this, the figure shows itself to you.</p>
<img src="assets/sprites/snail.png" width="46%" height="auto" class="center-image" />

<p>It is a giant snail, it does not seem to notice you are here and if nothing happens, you will bump into each other. I imagine it won't be a good experience as snails are known to be slimey.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">How will you face this upcoming task?</p>
